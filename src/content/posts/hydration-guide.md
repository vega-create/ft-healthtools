Staying hydrated is essential for every bodily function, from temperature regulation to nutrient transport. But the common advice of eight glasses a day is oversimplified.

## Factors Affecting Needs

Body weight is the primary factor: larger bodies need more water. Activity level matters because you lose water through sweat. Climate affects needs, with hot and humid conditions increasing requirements. Diet plays a role too, as fruits and vegetables contribute significant water.

## General Guidelines

A good starting point is half your body weight in ounces. A 160-pound person would aim for about 80 ounces (2.4 liters). Use our Water Intake Calculator for a personalized recommendation based on your weight, exercise, and climate.

## Signs of Dehydration

Thirst is a late indicator. Better markers include urine color (aim for pale yellow), frequency of urination (every 2-4 hours), energy levels, and headache presence. Even mild dehydration impairs concentration and mood.

## Overhydration

Drinking too much water is possible but rare. Hyponatremia (low sodium from excess water) typically only occurs during extreme endurance exercise. For most people, thirst and pale urine are sufficient guides.

## Practical Tips

Carry a water bottle and sip throughout the day rather than chugging large amounts at once. Drink a glass of water with each meal and one between meals. Eat water-rich foods like cucumber, watermelon, and oranges.
