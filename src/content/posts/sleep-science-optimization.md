Sleep is the single most effective thing you can do for your health. Quality sleep improves cognitive function, physical recovery, immune response, and emotional regulation.

## Sleep Cycles Explained

A complete sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes and includes light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. Most adults need 4-6 complete cycles per night. Waking between cycles rather than during one leaves you feeling more refreshed.

## Optimal Sleep Duration

Most adults need 7-9 hours. Individual needs vary, but consistently sleeping fewer than 6 hours impairs cognitive performance as much as being legally drunk. Use our Sleep Calculator to find optimal bed and wake times.

## Sleep Hygiene Basics

Keep a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. Make your bedroom dark, cool (65-68°F), and quiet. Avoid screens for 30-60 minutes before bed. Limit caffeine after noon and alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime.

## The Temperature Connection

Body temperature naturally drops at night to initiate sleep. A cool room helps this process. A warm shower before bed also helps because the rapid cooling afterward signals your body to sleep.

## When to Seek Help

If you consistently have trouble falling asleep, wake frequently during the night, or feel unrested despite adequate time in bed, consult a healthcare provider. Sleep disorders like sleep apnea are common and treatable.
