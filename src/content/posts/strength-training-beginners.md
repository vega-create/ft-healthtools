Strength training is one of the most beneficial forms of exercise at any age. It builds muscle, strengthens bones, boosts metabolism, and improves daily function.

## Benefits Beyond Muscle

Strength training increases bone density, reducing osteoporosis risk. It improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. It reduces injury risk by strengthening connective tissues. It also provides significant mental health benefits.

## Starting Out

Begin with 2-3 sessions per week on non-consecutive days. Focus on compound movements that work multiple muscle groups: squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, and rows. Start with light weight to learn proper form.

## Progressive Overload

The key principle of strength training is progressive overload: gradually increasing the challenge over time. Add weight when you can complete all sets with good form. Even small increases accumulate to significant progress.

## Understanding Your One Rep Max

Your one rep max (1RM) is the maximum weight you can lift once. Most training uses percentages of 1RM. Use our One Rep Max Calculator to estimate yours from lighter lifts, which is safer than testing directly.

## Recovery Matters

Muscles grow during rest, not during exercise. Sleep 7-9 hours per night. Eat adequate protein, roughly 0.7-1 gram per pound of body weight. Use our Macro Calculator to set appropriate targets. Allow 48 hours before training the same muscle group again.
