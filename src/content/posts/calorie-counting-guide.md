Calorie counting is one of the most straightforward approaches to managing weight. Understanding your energy balance helps you make informed food choices.

## Energy Balance Basics

Weight management comes down to calories in versus calories out. To lose weight, consume fewer calories than you burn. To gain weight, consume more. One pound of body fat is roughly 3,500 calories.

## Finding Your TDEE

Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is how many calories you burn each day. It includes your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) plus activity calories. Use our Calorie Calculator to estimate your TDEE based on age, weight, height, and activity level.

## Practical Tracking Tips

You do not need to track forever. Track for 2-4 weeks to learn portion sizes and calorie content of common foods. Focus on accuracy, not perfection. Weigh food when possible rather than estimating.

## Common Mistakes

Forgetting liquid calories is a common error. Underestimating cooking oils and dressings can add hundreds of untracked calories. Setting calories too low leads to muscle loss and metabolic adaptation.

## A Healthy Approach

Use our Macro Calculator to ensure balanced nutrition. Prioritize protein to maintain muscle and feel full. Eat mostly whole foods. Allow flexibility for enjoyment. If tracking causes stress or disordered eating patterns, stop and consult a professional.
