Heart rate training uses your pulse to guide exercise intensity. Training in different zones produces different physiological adaptations.

## Finding Your Max Heart Rate

The simplest estimate is 220 minus your age. More accurate methods include a lab test or a field test (all-out effort after warm-up). Use our Heart Rate Zones calculator for personalized zones.

## The Five Zones

Zone 1 (50-60% max) is recovery pace, good for warm-ups and cool-downs. Zone 2 (60-70%) is the fat-burning zone where you can hold a conversation. Zone 3 (70-80%) is aerobic training that improves cardiovascular fitness. Zone 4 (80-90%) is threshold training that improves speed and lactate tolerance. Zone 5 (90-100%) is maximum effort for short intervals.

## Zone 2 Training

Most endurance athletes spend 80% of training time in Zone 2. It builds aerobic base, improves fat oxidation, and promotes recovery. You should be able to hold a conversation while in Zone 2.

## Applying Zones

For general fitness, mix Zone 2 endurance sessions with one or two higher intensity sessions per week. For weight loss, Zone 2 burns the highest percentage of calories from fat. For performance, include Zone 4 and 5 intervals.

## Monitoring Tips

A heart rate monitor provides real-time feedback. Wrist-based monitors are convenient but less accurate than chest straps. Track your resting heart rate over time as a measure of fitness improvement.
